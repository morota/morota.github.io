Title: MS/PhD positions in statistical / quantitative genetics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln

Graduate research assistantships in statistical / quantitative genetic analysis of rumen microbiome data are available with Dr. Gota Morota and Dr. Samodha Fernando in the Department of Animal Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

Potential projects include, but are not limited to, the following: longitudinal analysis of microbial populations, predicting phenotypes from microbial information, inferring the impact of host genetic variation on microbiome composition, rumen microbial functional analysis using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, and investigating the role of viruses within the ruminant ecosystem. 

Candidates should have a B.S. or M.S. degree in quantitative disciplines (e.g., quantitative genetics, statistical genetics, animal breeding, mathematical science, or bioinformatics) along with a strong background and interest in statistical computing. 

A letter of interest in the position, C.V., and contact information for three references should be emailed to Gota Morota <morota@unl.edu> and Samodha Fernando <samodha@unl.edu>. Review of applications will begin immediately, and continue until the positions are filled. Informal inquiries are also welcome.
